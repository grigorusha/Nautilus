This is the simplest simulator for puzzles from the Nautilus and Square-1 class

for now the functionality is minimal: there are different types of puzzles specified in the code. shapes: spiral, circle, square. scramble works.
you can rotate the shape to the first stop, or to a minimal angle - you need to put a tick at the bottom.
